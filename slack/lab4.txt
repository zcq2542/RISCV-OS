Exercise 5:

Q: After uncommenting the line in apps/user/crash3.c,
   what do you see when running `crash3 proc` in egos?
   And why?
   (Explain in fewer than 3 sentences)


A: It successfully modified the memory. But cause an illegal instruction execption.
   Because it change the memory of first sys proccess -- sys_proc in FREE_MEM_START
   When using mmu_switch to this process the modified memory copy to the APPS_ENTRY cause the exception.
   


Q2: Can you prevent `crash3 proc` using PMP?
    Why and why not?

  No. If we set that part of memory as read only, it will prevent loading elf file from disk to FREE_MEM. The operating system will not work.
